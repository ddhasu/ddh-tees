ઢichau ( અલ્યા ! જો કેટલી બધી બુલેટ્સ )
-----------------------------------
* ઢ is epitome of dumbness. We are proud to be considered dumb.
* ઢ is an attempt to be different at the cost of being considered dumb. We are OK with that.
* ઢ is easy way to identify a fellow gujarati hacker/geek/nerd. If (s)he took-time-and-gave-money to wear [ddd-tee] (https://github.com/samyakbhuta/ddh-tees). Mostly but not necessarily, (s)he deals with Gujarati Unicode Characters for one or other reason.
* Do not ask for what ઢ can do for you, ask how much ઢ you can become today.
